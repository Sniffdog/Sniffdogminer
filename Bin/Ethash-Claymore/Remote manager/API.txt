EthMan uses raw TCP/IP connections (not HTTP) for remote management and statistics. Optionally, "psw" field is added to requests is the password for remote management is set for miner.
The following commands are available (JSON format):

REQUEST:
{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"miner_getstat1"}

RESPONSE:
{"result": ["9.3 - ETH", "21", "182724;51;0", "30502;30457;30297;30481;30479;30505", "0;0;0", "off;off;off;off;off;off", "53;71;57;67;61;72;55;70;59;71;61;70", "eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999", "0;0;0;0"]}
"9.3 - ETH"				- miner version.
"21"					- running time, in minutes.
"182724"				- total ETH hashrate in MH/s, number of ETH shares, number of ETH rejected shares.
"30502;30457;30297;30481;30479;30505"	- detailed ETH hashrate for all GPUs.
"0;0;0"					- total DCR hashrate in MH/s, number of DCR shares, number of DCR rejected shares.
"off;off;off;off;off;off"		- detailed DCR hashrate for all GPUs.
"53;71;57;67;61;72;55;70;59;71;61;70"	- Temperature and Fan speed(%) pairs for all GPUs.
"eth-eu1.nanopool.org:9999"		- current mining pool. For dual mode, there will be two pools here.
"0;0;0;0"				- number of ETH invalid shares, number of ETH pool switches, number of DCR invalid shares, number of DCR pool switches.

COMMENTS:

- ETH accepted shares for every GPU.
- ETH rejected shares for every GPU.
- ETH invalid shares for every GPU.
- DCR accepted shares for every GPU.
- DCR rejected shares for every GPU.
